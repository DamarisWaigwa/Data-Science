# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives**
# * List popular languages for Data
# * List common libraries used in data Science
# * Evaluating arithmetic expressions in python

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Java
# 5. Scala
# 6. C++

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Seaborn
# 4. Matplotlib

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[2]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[7]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 
minutes = 200
def conhrs(minutes):
    hours = minutes // 60
    
    return(hours)

conhrs(200)
